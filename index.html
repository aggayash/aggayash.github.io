I completed my MBA from Tepper School of Business with a focus on marketing, strategy and business technologies. 
I have been involved in the creation of startups involving vehicle automation/robotics (<a href ="https://gocartai.com/"> GoCartAi</a>)
My interests lie at the crossroads of automation, AI, and business development challenges in these areas. Prior to business school, I worked at Cisco as a product development lead for both hardware and software platforms for NGXR. I also hold a M.S. in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.
